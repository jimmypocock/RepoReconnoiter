# RepoReconnoiter Environment Configuration
#
# DEVELOPMENT/TEST: Copy this file to .env and set your actual values
# PRODUCTION: Set these as environment variables in your hosting platform
#              (e.g., Render Dashboard > Environment tab)
#
# NOTE: .env files are gitignored and should NEVER be deployed to production

#--------------------------------------
# Comparison Caching Configuration
#--------------------------------------

# Similarity threshold for fuzzy query matching (0.0 - 1.0)
# Higher values = stricter matching, fewer cache hits, fewer false positives
# Lower values = looser matching, more cache hits, higher risk of wrong results
# Recommended: 0.8 (high precision - catches exact matches + typos, ~99% accuracy)
COMPARISON_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.8

# Cache TTL in days - comparisons older than this are considered stale
# Recommended: 7 days for MVP, adjust based on how fast repos change
COMPARISON_CACHE_DAYS=7
